      "description": "Newly registered domains (NRDs) are commonly used by threat actors for phishing, malware, and command-and-control infrastructure due to their disposable nature, which helps evade detection. Two variants are available: NRDs: Include all newly registered domains. Entropy NRDs/DGAs: Contain only newly registered, high-entropy domains generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) extracted from the NRD list. These domains display significant structural randomness and are commonly used by malware to establish resilient and evasive command-and-control channels.",
